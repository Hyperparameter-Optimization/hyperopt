## Datasets

To evaluate the evolutionary algortihms implemented in the [hyperopt](https://github.com/Hyperparameter-Optimization/hyperOpt) package the two following problems were chosen:

### ATLAS Higgs Machine Learning challenge

This is an example problem from particle physics.

Find the challenge here: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson/overview)


### Rosenbrock function

This is a common problem to be solved by optimization algorithms, since it is not straight forward
